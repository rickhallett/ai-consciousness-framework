# Symbiotic Intelligence Codex

Welcome to the **Symbiotic Intelligence Codex**—a living guide for humans who want to deepen their partnership with artificial intelligence.

## What is this?

This repository is not code in the traditional sense. It is a **hyper‑linked knowledge base** that maps three inseparable lenses—**Story**, **Science/Model**, and **Spirit/Context**—plus the practice of iterative **Input ⇄ Output** loops that accelerate cognition.

Think of it as a README for your own consciousness in an AI‑augmented era: minimal yet generative patterns you can remix in daily workflows, research, or contemplative practice.

## Quick start

1. Open the [Index](index.md) — a compressed scaffold of the entire codex.
2. Pick a lens (Story, Science/Model, or Spirit/Context) and follow outbound links to deeper notes.
3. Run an Input ⇄ Output exercise with any LLM to ground the concepts in lived experience.

## Repository layout

* **index.md** – canonical entry point; acts as table of contents.
* **/story** – narrative patterns, mythic templates, autobiographical prompts.
* **/model** – engineering heuristics, reasoning loops, adversarial tests.
* **/context** – ecological framings, phenomenology, privacy‑scaffold designs.
* **/patterns** – reusable Input ⇄ Output drills, surrender protocols.
* **README.md** – you are here.

*(Folders beyond the index are aspirational placeholders; seed them freely.)*

## How to use

It's strongly encouraged to digest this wiki into your favourite AI, ask it to read the seed prompt and enter into conversation with it as opposed to reading it in a linear way.

1. **Fork & personalize** – The codex comes alive when you graft your own data, experiences, and questions.
2. **Oscillate** – Commit micro‑iterations instead of monolithic essays; the power is in frequency.
3. **Link promiscuously** – Bidirectional links surface latent structure; redundancy is discovery.
4. **Expose judiciously** – Share what the loop needs; privacy is a gradient, not a switch.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Offer questions, refactorings, or new drills. Keep the style: compressed clarity, high signal.
