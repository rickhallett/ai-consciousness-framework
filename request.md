| **1 On-ramp clarity**      | “After reading *README.md* and the seed-prompt XML, list every point where you hesitated or were unsure what to do next.”                                                                                     | Pinpoints wording, ordering, or missing context that blocks first use—highest friction multiplier to fix early.                |
| **2 Copy-paste viability** | “Paste the exact prompt you fed into the LLM and note any errors (token limits, malformed XML, unexpected model response).”                                                                                   | Reveals real-world divergence between our ideal flow and actual model/client behaviour; surfaces silent failures we can’t see. |
| **3 Loop usefulness**      | “Run three short iterate-refine cycles on a real task. For each, rate (1–5) how much the seed prompt improved speed or insight vs. starting cold, and describe the moment it first felt helpful or limiting.” | Quantifies value-add and exposes where the framework stops paying dividends so we can tighten or drop elements.                |

These three probes cover **orientation**, **mechanics**, and **perceived value**—the fastest signals for deciding whether to rewrite docs, change the XML surface, or adjust the conceptual lenses.
